    <h3>A Hot Delicious Pizza!!</h3>
    <p>This is a pizza that you want to eat, hot with cheese and pepperoni with tomato sauce ready to enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F: If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so
            it is nice and hot as well.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5
            minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch
            diameter circle.</li>
        <li>Add the toppings: Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large
            cast-iron. Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the pizza: If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve: Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.</li>
    </ol>
