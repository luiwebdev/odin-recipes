    <h3>Creamy peanut butter fudge dessert</h3>
    <p>A recipe that takes less than 10 minutes to prepare, chills for just an hour, and makes a super creamy peanut butter fudge.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) container frosting (vanilla or cream cheese are favorites), about 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) container no-stir creamy peanut butter, such as Jif or Skippy, about 2 cups</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pan: Line an 8 x 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Combine frosting and peanut butter: Combine the frosting and peanut butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Don’t worry about mixing them together yet. Microwave on high for 30 seconds, stir with a spatula, and microwave again for 30 seconds. Mix again until completely smooth. </li>
        <li>Pour into the pan and refrigerate: Pour into the prepared pan. You can press some chopped peanuts or peanut butter cups into the top or drizzle with melted chocolate if you like. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set. Use the parchment to remove from the pan and cut into 24 pieces to serve. Store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
